## Code Linting

This project is set up with [eslint](https://eslint.org/) using the [airbnb style guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb). 

The airbnb and eslint versions being used include support for most of the webpack and babel features, but [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) was required to get *all* features working, ie. static properties. 

To lint this project run the following command:

```
yarn lint
```
